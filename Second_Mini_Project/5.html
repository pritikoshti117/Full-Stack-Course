<p>Popularly known as the City of Gates, Aurangabad is among the prominent historical places to visit near Pune. The city was founded in 1610 AD by Malik Ambar, the Prime Minister of Murtaza Nizam Shah of Ahmadnagar and his son Fateh Khan changed the original name Khadki to Fatehnagar. The areas around Aurangabad were under the control of Delhi Sultanates, Bahamani Sultans, Nizam Shahis, Mughals, and Hyderabad Nizams. With the capture of Daulatabad by Mughals in 1633 AD, the Nizam Shahi dominions, including Fatehnagar, came under the possession of the Mughals. In 1653 when Prince Aurangzeb was appointed the viceroy of the Deccan for the second time, he made Fatehnagar his capital and called it Aurangabad. After Aurangzeb, the city became part of the princely state of Hyderabad until 1956 AD when it was merged with the Bombay state and eventually the state of Maharashtra in 1960 AD.</p>
